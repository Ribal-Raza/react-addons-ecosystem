# Context API
The React Context API provides a mechanism for **globally sharing data between React components, regardless of their nesting level**. It eliminates the need for prop drilling, where data is manually passed down through each component in the hierarchy. This simplifies state management and improves code maintainability for complex applications with shared data needs.

### **Problems solved by Context API:**

-   **Prop drilling redundancy:** Passing props through multiple levels of components becomes tedious and error-prone.
-   **Component state limitations:** Local component state cannot be easily accessed by sibling or deeply nested components.
-   **State management alternatives complexity:** Libraries like Redux require additional setup and boilerplate code.

**Context API offers a lightweight and built-in solution for data sharing, making it a valuable tool for specific use cases.**
